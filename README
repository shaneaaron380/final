To run any of the inputs against any of the implemnetations run:

	$ make <implementation><number>

So, for example, to run our CUBLAS implementation against input 2:

	$ make cublas2

Or to run our GPU implementation against input 3:

	$ make gpu3

Or to run our sequentail implementation against input 2:

	$ make seq2

Note that this will download and create a number of test matrices in the "inputs/" directory, so it will take much longer on the first run.

Running manually:

Build sequential, GPU, and CUBLAS:

	$ make

Command line examples (binary name is the same as the name of the root directory where the Makefile and project files reside):

Run GPU:

	$ bin/<binary> inputs/test_input_1a.txt inputs/test_input_1b.txt 1.0 G obj/test_input_1.txt.gpu.out

Run CUBLAS:
	
    $ bin/<binary> inputs/test_input_1a.txt inputs/test_input_1b.txt 1.0 C obj/test_input_1.txt.gpu.out

Run sequential:

	$ bin/<binary> inputs/test_input_1a.txt inputs/test_input_1b.txt 1.0 S obj/test_input_1.txt.gpu.out

A number of job scripts are available in the jobscripts directory.  So if you wanted to run one of the above in a jobscript on TACC you could run:

	$ mkdir obj
	$ qsub jobscripts/job_script.make_gpu2
