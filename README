To run any of the inputs against any of the implemnetations run:

	$ make <implementation><number>

So, for example, to run our CUBLAS implementation against input 2:

	$ make cublas2

Or to run our GPU implementation against input 3:

	$ make gpu3

Or to run our sequentail implementation against input 2:

	$ make seq2

Note that this will download and create a number of test matrices in the "inputs/" directory, so it will take much longer on the first run.
